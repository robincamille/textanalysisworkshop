# This is a Python script.

# This is a comment! Everything in red after a # is a helper note.
# The comment at the top usually tells you what the script does.
# The computer reads the code from top to bottom, doing
# whatever it says, generally in that order.

# Python can do math
print 10 * 8
10 * 4



# Python can do cool things with text
mytext = "We all live in a yellow submarine."

print mytext

# How many letters long is it?
print len(mytext), "characters"



mytitles = ["A Hard Day's Night", "Can't Buy Me Love", "Help!"]
# We just made a list. Lists go between brackets.

for title in mytitles:
    print title[0:4] # What does this do??


# Ready? Select Run > Run module


# Tasks:
# 0. Match up the output to the code in this script
# 1. Change mytext to something else and run it again
# 2. Change [0:4] to something else and run it again
# 3. Take the quotes out from the mytext line. What happens?
